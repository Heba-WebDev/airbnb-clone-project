# Introduction 
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## üèÜ Project Objectives
### User Management:

Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.

### Property Management: 

Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.

### Booking System:

Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.

### Payment Processing:

Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.

### Review System:

Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

### Data Optimization:

Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features Overview

1. API Documentation

2. User Authentication

3. Property Management

4. Booking System

5. Payment Processing

6. Review System

7. Database Optimizations

## Roles

### üîß Backend Role
#### Responsibilities:
- Develop REST and GraphQL APIs using Django and Django REST Framework.

- Implement user authentication and authorization.

- Design and manage PostgreSQL schemas and optimize database performance.

- Build and manage business logic for property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.

- Integrate asynchronous tasks using Celery and Redis (e.g., for notifications and background jobs).

- Write unit and integration tests for APIs.

- Ensure API documentation is accurate and up-to-date (e.g., using Swagger or GraphQL Playground).

 
### üé® Frontend Role
#### Responsibilities:

- Build user interfaces for guest and host workflows (listing properties, booking, reviewing, etc.).

- Integrate with the backend APIs (REST and/or GraphQL).

- Manage state (e.g., with Redux, Zustand, or Context API).

- Implement authentication flows (login, signup, profile management).

- Handle payment UI and communication with the backend payment endpoint.

- Ensure responsive design and good UX across devices.

- Work closely with the backend to consume API endpoints effectively.

### üöÄ DevOps Role
#### Responsibilities:

- Containerize the application using Docker for development and production environments.

- Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).

- Manage environments (staging, production).

- Set up Redis and PostgreSQL as services in Docker Compose.

- Monitor server health, log errors, and optimize for scalability.

- Deploy the app (e.g., to AWS, DigitalOcean, or a VPS) with proper environment variable and secret management.
